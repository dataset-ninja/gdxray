**GDXray+: The GRIMA X-ray Database** is a dataset for object detection and classification tasks. It is used in the security industry. 

The dataset consists of 20966 images with 1831 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*object of interest*).

Images in the GDXray+ dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 19834 (95% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 5 groups: ***baggages*** (9700 images), ***nature*** (8290 images), ***castings*** (2727 images), ***settings*** (151 images), and ***welds*** (98 images). Additionally, every image has its own ***series*** tag. The dataset was released in 2015 by the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Universidad de Atacama, Chile, BAM, Germany, Universidad de Santiago de Chile, and Universidad Adolfo Ibanez.
